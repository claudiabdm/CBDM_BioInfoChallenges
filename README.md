# CBDM_BioInfoChallenges
A code repository for the Bioinformatics Programming Challenges course of the Master's degree in Computional Biology. 

## Assignment 1:
Program to simulate the planting of a number of seeds in a stock database and save the updated data to a new file. It also reports the genes that are genetically linked.
  - Input files: gene_information.tsv seed_stock_data.tsv cross_data.tsv new_file_data.tsv
  - Output file: new_file_data.tsv

Last row of each data file was added to test the program.

## Assignment 2:
This program will find protein-protein interactions between genes from a gene codes list and will predict possible interaction networks. It will return a report file with all the interaction networks with KEGG and GO functional annotations for the network and for members. 
  - Input files: gene_codes_list.txt name_report_file.txt
  - Output file: name_report_file.txt
