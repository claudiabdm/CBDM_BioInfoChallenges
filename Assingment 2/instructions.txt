### INSTRUCTIONS
A recent paper (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108567) executes a meta-analysis of a few thousand published co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis.  
They break these co-expression sets into ~20 sub-networks of <200 genes each, that they find consistently co-expressed with one another.  
Assume that you want to take the next step in their analysis, and see if there is already information linking these predicted sub-sets into known regulatory networks.  
One step in this analysis would be to determine if the co-expressed genes are known to bind to one another.

Take the co-expressed gene list from Table S2 of the supplementary data from their analysis (I have extracted the data as text for you on the course Moodle → a list of AGI Locus Codes).  
Using a combination of the dbFetch, the Togo REST API, EBI’s PSICQUIC (IntAct) REST, and/or the DDBJ KEGG REST interface, and the Gene Ontology, 
find all protein-protein interaction networks that members of that list participate in, and determine which members of this gene list interact with each other.  
USE COMMON SENSE FILTERS IN YOUR CODE! (e.g. for species!!!).

TASKS:  

Create an “InteractionNetwork” Object to contain the members of each network

Annotate it with any KEGG Pathways the interaction network members are part of both KEGG ID and Pathway Name

Annotate it with the GO Terms associated with the total of all genes in the network
BUT ONLY FROM THE biological_process part of the GO Ontology!

Both GO:ID and GO Term Name

Create a report of which members of the gene list interact with one another, together with the KEGG/GO functional annotations of those interacting members.

BONUS MARKS (to get +2% up to a perfect score)
+1% if you create a ‘uso-general’ annotation object that can hold any functional annotation
+1% if you also annotate with the AraCyc pathways (see linked file on Moodle)

Hints:  You need to make "smart" decisions...  A interacts with B interacts with A creates an infinite loop.   
A interacts with B interacts with C interacts with D interacts with E interacts with F... how deep should you go?


### MESSAGE
Dear Class,

We didn't have time to discuss Assignment #2 deeply, so I am sending this message to give you some additional hints and advice.

The example URL that I provide in the Moodle - the IntAct service from EBI - is one possible protein-protein interaction database that uses the Psicquic REST interface. 
Others are here: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/psicquic/registry/registry?action=STATUS (the ones highlighted in red are currently not working). 

* Note that many of these ONLY CONTAIN HUMAN PROTEINS, so they will not be useful for you! 
I would suggest that you use the EBI service at the URL that I give you in the instructions. 

* Note also: The EBI IntAct service can accept Arabidopsis AGI Locus Codes as the query 
(which is what you have in your assignment data file), which means you DON'T NEED TO CONVERT the AGI Code to a UniProt protein identifier... 
so its probably best to use EBI IntAct smile).

* Note also: Protein-protein interaction databases OFTEN CONTAIN INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PROTEINS IN DIFFERENT SPECIES!!!!! 
You will need to create a filter to make sure that you are only getting interactions with other Arabidopsis proteins! 
(I will look for this in your code, and if you don't do it, you will lose points)

* Finally, note that some protein-protein interaction technologies generate many false-positives... you might want to read (or ask someone knowledgeable) to discover which technologies are the most accurate, 
and then filter the results based on which technology generated the interaction recorded in the database. 
False positives quickly result in an interaction network that is totally meaningless smile (everything interacts with everything!)

This is the most difficult assignment of the year, so please start thinking about it soon!

See you next week!

Mark
